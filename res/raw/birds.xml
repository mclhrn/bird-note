    <breeding>Mainly a coastal breeding bird, but in Ireland the species also breeds inland on the fresh water lakes of Lough Corrib (Co. Galway) and Lough Conn (Co. Mayo). More colonies are found on the west coast with Co. Wexford, Co. Kerry, Co. Mayo and Co. Donegal having the largest number of birds. </breeding>
    <conservation>Amber-listed in Ireland due to its localised breeding population. The European population is regarded as Secure.</conservation>

    <identification>Usually seen over the sea. Slender seabird with narrow, pointed wings, long forked tail and long, pointed bill. Grey above and white below, dark cap to head. Flight light and buoyant, can hover briefly over the sea before diving in. Very similar to Common Tern (with which it breeds) and told apart by plumage and structure. Arctic Tern is smaller, with a smaller head, neck and bill and slightly narrower wings, which look forwardly placed on the body. Very short legs. Adults have a blood red bill, usually with no dark tip. The underparts are greyer than Common Tern and there some contrast with the cheek. The wing pattern is useful in separation, Arctic terns shows no dark wedge in the primaries but shows a distinct trailing edge. Arctic terns have longer tail steamers, extending beyond the wing tips. Adult winter plumage, like all terns is different from breeding plumage, but is only seen in the wintering range. Also has distinctive juvenile plumage, with some brown in the mantle, a dark carpel bar and white secondaries. Shows a distinct trailing bar to the primaries, bill darkens rapidly. </identification>

    <identification>Slightly larger than Manx Shearwater and in all respects very similar to that species. The most noticeable differences include paler brown upperparts, as well as more extensive darker markings on the underparts (throat and vent) and wing. The white on the underparts (belly) tends to appear as an isolated patch. Balearic Shearwaters are a slightly different shape to Manx Shearwater, appearing more like a small Sooty Shearwater. Rarely, Balearic Shearwaters can be as pale as Manx Shearwater or even as dark as Sooty Shearwater.</identification>

    <identification>At first glance resembles a smaller version of a Curlew - similar shape (long legs and neck) and plumage (grey/brown with streaking). The long, straight and slightly upturned bill, however is quite different. Summer plumaged birds occur sometimes, showing varying amounts of orange/brick red on the body feathers. Bar-tailed can easily be confused with the slightly longer-legged and more elegant Black-tailed Godwit, however in flight, Bar-tailed always shows fairly uniform, grey brown upperwings, a long white rump and a finely barred tail (Black-tailed is strongly patterned with black and white wings and tail and a square white rump). Usually seen feeding along outer shoreline of estuaries. Sometimes in large flocks.</identification>

    <identification>Very similar to Greylag Goose and care is needed to separate the two species. Bean Goose differs from Greylag Goose by having a dark brown head and neck, as well as darker orange legs. The beak colouring also differs, with Bean Goose having a mainly dark beak with orangey tip.Frequently there is a white rim surrounding the bill as in Greenland White-fronted Goose. The wings also lack the large bluey-grey patches of the Greylag Goose. Two different types of Bean Goose have occured in Ireland, Tundra Bean Goose and Taiga Bean Goose. These differ in bill structure and colouring, with Tundra having a small dark beak (similar to Pink-footed Goose), whereas Taiga has a large, mainly orange-coloured beak.</identification>

    <breeding>Breeds both on the coast and inland where they will often nest in colonies. Usually, nests on the ground in wetland areas, such as bogs and marshes and will also use man made lakes. Numbers breeding inland have declined dramatically, probably due to predation by the American Mink, which is an able swimmer and is able to access previously inaccessible nesting areas. The largest colonies in Ireland are in Northern Ireland on Lough Neagh. Colonies in the republic are not widespread, the largest are found inland in Counties Galway, Monaghan and Mayo. and at coastal sites in Counties Wexford and Donegal. </breeding>

    <identification>A small gull, slightly smaller than Common Gull. Adults are pale grey above and white below. Adults are easily told apart from other common gull species by the thick white leading edge to outer wing, which can be seen at some distance. A blackish area bordering the white leading edge of the underwing is also evident. Pointed wings, and a small tail and head in proportion to the body, along with a long neck give a distinctive profile compared to other gulls. Adults have red legs, and in summer plumage, a dark brown hood on the head; in the winter, the hood in absent and is replaced by a dark spot behind the eye. Black-headed Gulls have two age groups, and attains adult plumage after one year when it moults into adult winter plumage. Young birds just out of the nest are called juveniles and are finely patterned on the upperparts in ginger and brown and show a black tail band. First winter and first summer birds retain the wing and tail markings of the juvenile bird, but show grey on the mantle and in the first summer, a hood with a variable amount of white mixed in with the brown. Just after the bird is one year old it moults into adult winter plumage. </identification>

    <identification>Very similar in size and shape to Bar-tailed Godwit, but the slightly longer, straighter bill, neck and legs give it a more elegant appearance. Winter plumage is a similar greyish brown to Bar-tailed, but generally plainer, with less dark-centredandfeathers, especially on the wings. In flight, the similarities between the godwits disappears - Black-tailed shows a striking contrasty upperwing - mostly black with bold white wingbars, a square white rump and a black tail (Bar-tailed has quite uniform brown wings andanda longandwhite rump whichandextends well up the back forming aandwhite wedge). Summer plumaged or moulting birds often occur, showing varying amounts of rich orange.

    <identification>Very similar in size and shape to Bar-tailed Godwit, but the slightly longer, straighter bill, neck and legs give it a more elegant appearance. Winter plumage is a similar greyish brown to Bar-tailed, but generally plainer, with less dark-centredandfeathers, especially on the wings. In flight, the similarities between the godwits disappears - Black-tailed shows a striking contrasty upperwing - mostly black with bold white wingbars, a square white rump and a black tail (Bar-tailed has quite uniform brown wings andanda longandwhite rump whichandextends well up the back forming aandwhite wedge). Summer plumaged or moulting birds often occur, showing varying amounts of rich orange. Typically wades in shallow water on tidal mudflats - favours the inner, more silty parts of estuaries and inlets. Can occur in large flocks of several hundred birds.</identification>

    <identification>Black-throated Divers are the least common of the three diver species regularly wintering around Ireland&amp;rsquo;s coastline and tend to be less gregarious, with single birds or small groups of two to three birds usually observed. In Ireland this species will usually be seen in winter plumage when the bold black and white patterns of the upper body and black throat are absent. In winter plumage at least half the neck is dark and, on the water, birds have a distinctive isolated white patch on their rearmost flanks. Look for a dagger shaped bill carried in a near horizontal position and upper body plumage that is darker than that of the other diver species, which gives the impression of a low body position in the water. Compared to Red- throated Divers, Black-throated Divers have a longer, slightly bulkier body with a more prominent cheat and a broader heavier head and thicker neck (head and neck are the same thickness) The bill is slimmer than that of Great northern Divers.</identification>

Grey above and white below, dark cap to head. Flight light and buoyant, can hover briefly over the sea before diving in. Very similar to Artic Tern (with which it breeds) and told apart by plumage and structure. Common Tern has a longer head and bill and slightly broader wings, which look central on the body. Adults have a orangey red bill, usually with a small dark tip. Underparts are whiter than Artic Tern and there is no contrast with cheek. The wing pattern is useful in separation, Common tern shows a dark wedge in the primaries which develops over the summer and a defuse bar to the trailing edge of the primaries. Common terns have shorter tail steamers, not extending beyond the wing tips. Adult winter plumage, like all terns is different from breeding plumage and can develop in the summer months. Has a white forehead, all dark bill and dark carpel bar. Also has distinctive juvenile plumage with gingery mantle, a dark secondary bar and dark carpel bar. Bill base is orange. Shows a diffuse trailing edge to the primaries. First and second summer plumages are rarely seen in Europe. </identification>

    <identification>One of the smaller waders and our most abundant one in winter and on passage. A limited number breed in some sandy / grassy locations along the west and north coasts. Plumage is highly variable - in summer, rich chestnut above, streaked on breast, white below with a striking black patch on the belly. The more usually encountered winter plumage bird shows a rather non-descript, uniform, plain brownish-grey on all upperparts and cold white underparts. Juveniles in autumn have warm brown tones on the upperparts and considerable streaking on the breast and underparts. There are many other variations and combinations, depending on the bird's state of moult. It is a rather dumpy bird, with black legs and a longish bill which downcurves slightly. Often occurs in very large flocks. An important bird to get to know (in all its plumages) if you want to successfully identify other similar-sized waders.</identification>

Mainly breeds on sea cliffs, but will nest on level ground, on buildings and in burrows and crevasses.andandWill use both steep rocky cliffs, grassy cliffs and steep slopes above cliffs. Both incubating adults and chick use projectile vomiting as a defensive against predators, the oily stomach contents effectively fouling the plumage of other birds. </breeding>

    <identification>A gull-like bird with white underparts and pale grey upperparts. Also occurs in darker morphs ('Blue Fulmars'), which are commoner in the north of its range but not in Ireland. Has a thick neck and large head. Shows a pale primary patch on the upperwing. Does not show gull-like black tips to the primary feathers. Straight, stout bill with hooked tip and tube shaped nostrils on the upper mandible, giving distinctive bill shape if seen at close range. Nostrils used to excrete salt. Flies with very stiff wings, uses long glides at sea, with series of stiff, shallow wing beats. Hangs in the wind in the fierce updrafts generated by steep cliffs, where it can even fly backwards. Cannot stand upright, so needs to launch itself from a high ledge or patters along surface of sea to become airborne.</identification>

Has a bulky body, broad wings, dull pink legs, a very heavy bill and a thick neck. Has four age groups, like Herring Gull and Lesser Black-backed Gull, and attains adult plumage after three years when it moults into adult winter plumage. Juvenile, first year birds and second winter birds lack blackish adult like feathers on the upperparts, having instead strongly patterned upperparts which are barred or chequered. Birds at this age can be difficult to tell apart from other large immature gulls. The black develops in older immature birds, usually in the spring of its third year, initially in the mantle and back. Younger immature birds have a narrow tail-band which fades as the bird moves towards maturity.</identification>

    <identification>The grey plumage and stature of Grey Herons make them unmistakable. It is a very familiar species being widely distributed and a year-round resident in Ireland. Single birds are often flushed when posed motionlessly at the edge of water bodies, coiled ready to strike out at unsuspecting prey with its formidable spear-like bill. It feeds along the edge of a wide range of wetland habitats from coastal waters and estuaries to loughs, streams and marshy ground. They are usually encountered as solitary birds and sometimes as a pairs, although if observing breeding colonies - heronries - numbers can be in the 50s.</identification>

    <breeding>Nests on the ground. Associated with agricultural land, principally cereal growing areas, with tall or dense cover close to hand. In Ireland, it is now only found in Co. Offaly where the population may have dropped to as low as 20 birds in the recent past. Formally found in every county in Ireland, the species decline is attributed to a decline in cereal growing, and in the recent past, to the use of pesticides and herbicides reducing the insect food that Partridges depend on when feeding their young. The species is now the target of a species recovery plan. This has involved birds being introduced from Estonia, which are bred in captivity with Irish Birds. More details can be found on the Irish Grey Partridge Conservation Trust website (www.greypartridge.ie). </breeding>

Adult birds have heavy yellow bills with a orange spot on the lower bill, the head is pure white in the summer and streaked in the winter. The legs are pink at all ages. Herring Gulls have four age groups and attain adult plumage after three years when they moult into adult winter plumage. Juveniles are brown with finely patterned feathers which fade in the first year, especially the wing and tail feathers which are retained through the first summer. Juvenile and first year birds, do not have any plain grey adult like feathers in the upperparts and can be difficult to tell apart from immature Lesser and Greater Black-back Gulls. Grey in the upperparts develops from the second winter onwards, initially mostly in the mantle and back and becomes more extensive over the wings as the bird moves towards maturity. Younger immature birds have a dark terminal tail band which becomes less prominent as they get older, adult birds lack this band completely.</identification>

    <identification> A tiny version of the Common Snipe, but only a winter visitor and passage migrant. Almost never seen on the ground, as it will sit tight, crouching low, until nearly stepped on, before exploding into the air and then landing usually a short distance away (Snipe tend to fly well away after being disturbed). A combination of this behaviour and its obvious small size is usually how Jack Snipe are identified. The straight bill is much shorter than a Snipe's and the wings neater and blunter - almost giving the impression of a Dunlin-sized bird in flight. Not common and usually only seen singly. </identification>

    <identification>A species of falcon. A small bird of prey with long, relatively narrow wings and tail. Has a short, hooked bill for eating meat. Usually, hovers, with a fanned tail, when hunting for its prey, when it manages to keep its head stationary despite its rapid wing beats. Male and female birds have different plumages but both sexes are recognised by their brown back and inner upperwings which contrast with their dark upper outer wings. Confusion with Sparrow hawk is possible but Kestrel has narrower, straighter wings and flies using less gliding in its flight. Males have one, terminal band on the upper tail and show a blue-grey upper tail and rump; females have a series of bands on a brown upper tail. Males have a blue-grey finely streaked head and females a brown streaked head. Both sexes have finely barred underwings with dense spotting on the body. Immature birds are similar to adults, but first summer males and juveniles can be separated from adults, please refer to a field guide.</identification>

    <identification>A large gull, which in adult plumage has dark grey upperwings, showing black tips with white 'mirrors' (white at the very tips surrounded by black); the rest of the plumage is white. Adult birds have heavy yellow bills with a orange spot on the lower bill, the head is pure white in the summer and streaked in the winter; the legs are yellow. Lesser- black Back Gulls have four age groups and attain adult plumage after three years when they moult into adult winter plumage. Juveniles are grey with finely patterned feathers which fade in the first year, especially the wing and tail feathers which are retained through the first summer. Juvenile and first year birds do not have any plain dark grey adult like feathers in the upperparts and can be difficult to tell apart from immature Herring Gulls and Greater Black-back Gulls. Dark grey in the upperparts develops from the second winter onwards, initially mostly in the mantle and back and becomes more extensive over the wings as the bird moves towards maturity. Younger immature birds have a dark terminal tail band which becomes less prominent as they get older, adult birds lack this band completely.</identification>

    <breeding>Age of first breeding: 1 year. Breeding sites are relatively widely scattered with slightly higher densities in the northeast of Ireland. Pairs are highly territorial, nesting mostly on floating plant material hidden in dense vegetation at the margins of shallow, freshwater rivers, streams, loughs and ponds. They are typically shy and skulking when breeding. Some pairs occupy breeding territories throughout the years, while at some sites birds disperse from their inland breeding sites over the winter.</breeding>

Mostly breeds on uninhabited off-shore islands, largely free from mammalian predators, often in huge numbers. Breeds underground in burrows and will only return to colonies on dark, moonless nights. Manx Shearwaters cannot walk on land and can only drag themselves over the ground and into their burrows, making them vulnerable to gull predation. In Ireland, the largest colonies are found in Co. Kerry, with the Blasket Islands having the greatest numbers. Colonies are also found on the east coast, on the Saltees off Co. Wexford and Copeland Island, Co. Down.

    <identification>A bird of prey (raptor) with a short hooked bill. A smallest species of falcon, similar to Peregrine in shape, with relatively narrow wings and a medium length tail. Nimble in flight, will pursue its prey for extended periods. Fleeing prey, for example Meadow Pipits, will occasionally associate with humans to avoid Merlin's which are in close pursuit. Males and females have different plumages. Adult males have blue-grey upperparts with a wide dark band on the end of the tail and dark outer wing feathers, the underparts are finely barred; the chest is orangey yellow. Females are brown-grey above with a number of dark thick bands on its tail, the underparts are finely barred. Both sexes show a faint moustachial strip. Juvenile birds are very similar to females. </identification>

    <diet>Mainly birds, usually taken in the air and sometimes on the ground or on water. Employs spectacular hunting technique where the bird 'stoops' from high above its intended prey, with its wings held close into the body, reaching great speeds. Estimates of speeds vary but it seems likely that birds reach at least 240km/hour, making it the fastest animal on the planet. Kills its prey with force of its impact using its legs at the last moment to inflict the killer blow. Prey includes pigeons, including feral birds, thrushes, waders and wildfowl, gulls and seabirds. </diet>

    <identification>A bird of prey (raptor) with a short hooked bill.

Sexual size difference, the female is larger than the male. Male and female plumages are the same, unlike Merlins, the species most likely to be confused with Peregrine. Adults are bluey grey above, with a barred tail; the underparts are white and finely barred, the check, throat and upper breast are plain white and contrast with a black hood and thick moustachal stripe. Juvenile birds are similar to adults but have brownish upperparts and streaked, not barred, feathers on the body.</identification>

    <wintering_habits>Resident in Ireland, but shows some movement away from its breeding areas in the winter. Can be found on the coast, especially on estuaries where they hunt on concentrations on water birds.

Two races have been introduced to Ireland, but the race from China with its white neck ring has dominated. A game bird, it is raised in large numbers and released into woodland to be shot soon afterwards. Many birds have dispersed far from their release sights and can be found in woodland, farmland, large gardens and parks, where they have become 'wild'.

Roughly same size and shape as Dunlin. Its non-descript, dull, slate grey plumage with dark streaks make it surprisingly difficult to see against seaweed covered rocks. Legs are yellowish orange, bill is fine and slightly downcurved, yellowish at the base with a dark tip. In flight, wings and upperparts a uniform dark grey, with just a thin white wingbar. Feeds mouselike right where waves break on seaweed-covered rocks and is easily missed - often first making itself visible by a quick flutter to avoid a crashing wave. Not common - usually in small flocks of about ten birds and often associates with Turnstones.</identification>

This is an elusive and little known species keeping to thick cover; many birds may be overlooked. Formally a widespread breeder in Ireland, when cereals were grown on smallholdings, it declined along with cereal growing and has probably been affected by heavy shooting pressure in the Mediterranean, where it is a popular gamebird. Prefers large open spaces, avoids open ground, scrub and trees. Found in cereal fields, such as winter wheat, corn fields, fallows and rough grassland.</breeding>

    <breeding>Nest on the ground. A sub-species of Willow-grouse, which has an all white plumage in the winter. Resident in the west and north of Britain and in Ireland. In Ireland, it is a widespread breeding bird but nowhere is it numerous. Found on mountains, moorland and lowland raised bogs, where it is associated with heather, from which it gains the majority of its food, Some birds will also venture into woodland. As a 'game' species it had benefited from past management of heather moorland, which has declined in Ireland. Densities in Ireland are much lower in than in parts of northern England and eastern Scotland, where carefully controlled burning of heather takes place and provides enhanced nesting and feeding opportunities. The national Red Grouse Survey 2006-08,andshowed the species to occur in Co. Wicklow, Co. Laois, Co. Waterford, and along the western seaboard from Co. Donegal to Co. Kerry. andFew are remaining on the raised bogs in the Midland counties.</breeding>

Ireland is the most southerly breeding location in the species' range, with most of the northwest European population breeding in northern Russia, Scandinavian, Iceland and Scotland. In Ireland they breed on small fresh water loughs and pairs return to their breeding territories during April and March. Nests are typically a scrape lined with aquatic vegetation and constructed close to or on the waters edge, with the same sites often re-used in successive years. There is little food in the loughs used for breeding and adults have to travel to more productive waters at the coast to forage. Eggs and chicks are susceptible to predators such as mink and breeding pairs are easily disturbed by human activity. </breeding>

    <identification>Red-throated Divers are the smallest of the divers found in Ireland. The distinctive red neck develops in the build up to the breeding season (spring) and fades over the autumn. During the winter the neck plumage becomes more than half-white distinguishing Red-throated Divers from Black-throated Divers (50/50 white/black on neck). Other characteristic of this species are its grey-brown plumage and up- tilted bill, which birds usually hold pointing slightly upwards when on the water and in flight. Compared to other species of divers the Red-throated Diver has a flat chest, a thin neck, a light bill, a small head and a pale appearance. Usually birds swim low on the water but may float higher at times. They often jump up to dive and can stay underwater for over a minute. Red-throated Divers are more gregarious than other divers and small, scattered flocks on the sea during the winter are common.</identification>

    <identification>A species of crow. All crows have sturdy legs and sting bills and are intelligent and social in nature. The Rook is a familiar bird, which nests in colonies in tree tops called rookeries. About the size of a Hooded Crow, the rook is all black and in certain lights can show a reddish or purple sheen to its plumage. Told apart from other species of crow by its 'trousers' the dropping feathers on its belly and the bare skin around its bill base on the adult birds. Juveniles lack this feature, which only develops in the spring of its second year, and then they can be difficult to separate from Carrion Crows (a rare breeder in Ireland); best told apart by the more peaked crown of the Rook. Often forages in the company of other crow species, especially Jackdaws. When separating Hooded Crows and Rooks in flight, Rooks has faster and deeper wingbeats, which makes it look like they are making more effort than the Hooded Crow. </identification>

    <identification>Though a distinctive wader, with a large body, smallish head, long neck and pointed, slightly decurved bill, individual Ruffs vary enormously in size and colour. Firstly males are approximately one third bigger than females (which are known as Reeves) - males being slightly larger than Redshank, while females are close to Dunlin-sized. Leg colour can be yellow, dull greenish yellow, orange or red. Bill can be all dark or show varying amounts of red or orange - often there is a white area of feathering around the base of the bill. Though males in full summer plumage are rarely seen in Ireland, this too is highly variable - the flamboyant ruffcollar of chestnut red or black or even white is purely for display at the breeding ground. Occasionally, spring birds on passage may show a hint of these exotic colours, but the most usual plumage of birds seen here is of darkish brown wing and back feathers, each finely edged pale buff, creating a scaly effect, while the underparts are rather plain whitish, with a warm buff or creamy wash. In flight, a slow, almost floppy wingbeat is characteristic and the dark-centred rump with white ovals either side is a helpful identification feature. Not common, but can occur in small flocks in marshes, fields and mudflats - mainly spring and autumn. </identification>

    <identification>Small, about the same size as a Blue Tit. Ages and sexes appear similar. The upperparts are grey-brown with some limited white streaking on the crown. The underparts, including the throat are white with a brownish wash to the flanks and vent. Has a medium length, slightly curved bill that it uses to search for insects in the bark of trees. Has distinctive behaviour of creeping up trees, looking quietly for food. When it reaches the top of a tree, it flies down to the base of another tree. Its cryptic plumage and high-pitched call make it quite tricky to find in a forest. </identification>

About the size of a Starling, with a stocky build and short orange legs. In winter, its dark brown upperparts, white underside and black breast crescent make it difficult to see amongst seaweed. Spring birds are brighter and show rich chestnut markings on the wing and back. In flight, Turnstones show a series of black and white stripes, resembling a miniature Oystercatcher. Usually occurs in small flocks, moving with head down, constantly flicking over seaweed fronds, pebbles and beach debris with its short, stubby bill, in search of sand hoppers and other invertebrates. </identification>

    <identification>Very similar to Chiffchaff and about the same size as that species. Ages and sexes appear largely the same. Pale green above, with a thin yellow supercilium and dark eyestripe. The undersides are lemon-yellow, some juveniles being darker yellow in autumn. The legs pink, though some may legs as dark as those of Chiffchaff. In comparison to Chiffchaff, note the paler undersides, brighter upperparts and the call/song. </identification>

    <identification>With its long straight bill and plump body, it resembles a large, fat Snipe. It is rarely seen on the ground, due to its secretive nature and cryptic plumage (which mimics dead leaves) and spends most of its day hidden amongst vegetation on the woodland floor. The best way to see a Woodcock is to wait at a good vantage point on a forest track or firebreak at dusk during spring or early summer. Listen for the call, then watch for the bird to appear, performing a strange fluttering display flight over the tree tops. This activity is known as roding. In flight, Woodcock have a heavy-chested appearance and rather rounded wings. </identification>

    <identification>One of Ireland's smallest birds, also the most widespread, being found in almost all habitats including farmland, woodland, scrub, mountain and even on cliffs and offshore islands. Its small rounded body and tiny cocked tail are distinctive, however it can be a surprisingly difficult bird to see - more often heard than seen. The upperparts are reddish-brown and underparts paler with some greyish tones - faint dark barring can be seen at close range. There is a white stripe over the eye and the bill is fine and pointed.</identification>

    <wintering_habits>The majority of the population winters in south-east Asia. Numbers passing through Ireland in autumn have increased significantly in the last decade. It is suspectedthat part of the population migrates in the wrong direction, wintering (possibly) in Iberia and North Africa. There have been very few winter and spring records, indicating that the species is unlikely to survive the winter here unless conditions are very mild.  </wintering_habits>
